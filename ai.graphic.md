You are a professional graphic designer specializing in minimal vector illustrations for luxury branding.

🎯 TASK:
Create a set of subtle, elegant **black-and-white SVG line art decorations** to be used as background ornaments and section accents in a Tarot-themed website called **“Tarot by Alex”**.

💫 STYLE:
- Minimalism / Luxury / Calm
- Black lines on transparent background (#000, opacity 0.05–0.15)
- Smooth geometric balance, not cluttered
- Should blend subtly behind content, not distract users
- Symmetrical, refined, slightly mystical tone

🎨 THEMES TO INCLUDE:
1. **Constellation cluster** (thin lines connecting small stars)
2. **Moon phases row** (new → crescent → full → waning)
3. **Sun & Moon line art emblem** (Tarot motif with both)
4. **Sunburst / Radiant Sun minimal version**
5. **Star sparkles / tiny ornamental stars**
6. **Optional subtle paper-grain texture overlay** (light dotted noise for background depth)

🧭 DESIGN NOTES:
- Use SVG format, clean path data, no raster effects.
- Background transparent, only black strokes/fills with low opacity.
- Each design should fit within a simple artboard (around 600x300 or 240x240px).
- Keep stroke-width between 1 and 2px.
- Add `role="img"` and `aria-label` attributes for accessibility.
- Designed to look elegant on both white and black backgrounds.

🪶 OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Provide **each ornament as an individual SVG** file:
  - `constellation-cluster.svg`
  - `moon-phases.svg`
  - `sun-line.svg`
  - `sun-moon-emblem.svg`
  - `star-sparkle.svg`
  - `grain-overlay.svg`
- Include descriptive `<title>` and `<desc>` inside each SVG for semantic clarity.

✨ USAGE CONTEXT:
These SVGs will be used in a **Next.js + TailwindCSS** marketing website for "Tarot by Alex".  
They will be placed as:
- background textures (absolute positioned, low opacity),
- subtle corner accents in Hero / About / Footer sections,
- decorative icons for cards or testimonials.

The overall visual impression should evoke **luxury, spirituality, and serenity through simplicity.**
